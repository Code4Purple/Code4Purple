# Defensive Security

This is the second major area within Security. While Offensive Security involves actively finding 
vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within technologies, Defensive Security involves detecting and stopping
these attacks.

	This career track is for you if:
		
		1. you are analytical
		2. you enjoy problem solving

One of the careers under this track is a Security Analyst. This is an individual in an organisation who's job is
to monitor various systems in the organisation and detect whether any of thses systems are being attacked.
To do this, you need to understand how underlying technologies work and then understand what attacks against
these technologies look like. You can learn about this using this room:

While a Security Analyst deals with detecting attacks, an incident Responder is usually brought in once an 
attack has already occurred. Their main responsibilities include understanding what actions an attacker has 
taken in the organisation and what the impact of their actions will be. Incident Responders also need to know 
how underlying technologies work and what potential attacks could be carried out against a system. They then
analyse trace evidence left by an attacker. You can learn about this on this room:

While this a very specialist role, malware analysis is quite common when detecting and responding to attacks.
Malicious actors would use mailcious pieces of software in any stage of their attack cycle from gaining access 
to a system to maintaining presistence. If you can understand what exactly this malware is doing, you can prevent 
further abuse and also identify the malicious action. You can learn about this on various rooms:

We also have a * Cyber Defence pathway * that covers a broad set of skills, tools and methodologies that would
allow you to understand the fundamentals required for entry level Blue Team Roles.
