Without a doubt, the ability to research effectively is the most important quality for a hacker to have. 
By its very nature, hacking requires a vast knowledge base â€” because how are you supposed to break into something 
if you don't know how it works? The thing is: no one knows everything. Everyone (professional or amateur, 
experienced or totally new to the subject) will encounter problems which they don't automatically know how 
to solve. This is where research comes in, as, in the real world, you can't ever expect to simply be 
handed the answers to your questions.
